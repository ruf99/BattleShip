# BattleShip

The  Battleship  game  is  played  on  a  two-dimensional  board.  
The  board  is typically  square  (usually  10x10  cells) and  the  individual  cells  in  the  grid  are identified  by  letters  and  numbers.  

In  this  simplified  version  of  Battleship,  only one  player  plays  against  the  computer.  
At  the  start  of  the  game,  the computer  secretly  places  one  (hidden)  ship  with  the  size  of  4  cells/  blocks  on the  board  in  a  random  location  
and  with  a  random  orientation, either horizontally  or vertically. As  the  location  of the  ship  is  concealed  from  the player,  the  goal  of  the  player  is  
to  "destroy"  the  ship  with  the  least  number  of guesses.  Hereby,  the  player  takes  turns  by  entering  a  coordinate  of  the target cell. 

If it is  a  hit, the  cell  is  marked  by  an  'X', otherwise  by  a  '#'  for  a miss.  
When  all  cells  of  the  ship  are  guessed  by  the  player,  the  ship  is  sunk and  the  game  is  won, displaying the number of attempts it took to destroy the ships.
